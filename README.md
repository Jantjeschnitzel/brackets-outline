Code Outline
==============
A small Eclipse-esque outline that lists all functions and CSS definitions in your current file, providing shortcuts for quick navigation.

### What's New
* Toggle Function Arguments
* Toggle Outline from Toolbar (Thanks to [Karsten Bruckmann](https://github.com/karsten-bruckmann)!)
* Show Outline in Sidebar or next to the Toolbar (Also thanks to Karsten!)

### Current Features
* List and Quickly Jump to Functions and CSS Definitions
* Hide Unnamed Functions
* Works for JS, PHP, and CSS

### Planned Features
In the future, I'd like to add arrays, objects, and variables to the outline and display them in a collapsible tree. But right now that's more of a nice-to-have for me, so I'm uncertain if and when I'll get around to it.
