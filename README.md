JS/CSS Outline
==============
A small Eclipse-esque outline that lists all functions and CSS definitions in your current file, providing shortcuts for quick navigation.

### Current Features
* List and Quickly Jump to Functions and CSS Definitions
* Hide Unnamed Functions

NOTE: I wrote it specifically for my web projects, but it'll work for any language with a "function name()" structure (name optional).

### Planned Features
In the future, I'd like to add arrays, objects, and variables to the outline and display them in a collapsible tree. But right now that's more of a nice-to-have for me, so I'm uncertain if and when I'll get around to it.
