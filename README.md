JS/CSS Outline
==============
A small Eclipse-esque outline that lists all functions and CSS definitions in your current file, providing shortcuts for quick navigation.

### Current Features
* List and Quickly Jump to Functions and CSS Definitions
* Hide Unnamed Functions

### Planned Features
In the future, I'd like to add arrays, objects, and variables to the outline and display them in a collapsible tree. But right now that's more of a nice-to-have for me, so I'm uncertain if and when I'll get around to it.

### How to Install
JS/CSS Outline is an extension for [Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/).

To install extensions:

1. Choose _File > Extension Manager_ and select the _Available_ tab.
